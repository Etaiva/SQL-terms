Challenge: Karaoke song selector
Step 1
Ever sung karaoke? It's a place where you sing songs with your friends, and it's a lot of fun. 
We've created a table with songs, and in this challenge, you'll use queries to decide what songs to sing. 
For the first step, select all the song titles.

CREATE TABLE songs (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT,
    artist TEXT,
    mood TEXT,
    duration INTEGER,
    released INTEGER);
    
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released)
    VALUES ("Bohemian Rhapsody", "Queen", "epic", 60, 1975);
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released)
    VALUES ("Let it go", "Idina Menzel", "epic", 227, 2013);
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released)
    VALUES ("I will survive", "Gloria Gaynor", "epic", 198, 1978);
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released)
    VALUES ("Twist and Shout", "The Beatles", "happy", 152, 1963);
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released)
    VALUES ("La Bamba", "Ritchie Valens", "happy", 166, 1958);
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released)
    VALUES ("I will always love you", "Whitney Houston", "epic", 273, 1992);
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released)
    VALUES ("Sweet Caroline", "Neil Diamond", "happy", 201, 1969);
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released)
    VALUES ("Call me maybe", "Carly Rae Jepsen", "happy", 193, 2011);
    
SELECT title FROM songs;
    
Step 2
Maybe your friends only like singing either recent songs or truly epic songs. 
Add another SELECT that uses OR to show the titles of the songs that have an 'epic' mood or a release date after 1990.

(Tip: If you're not sure how to select rows where a column equals a value, remember that you can check the documentation below.)

SELECT title FROM songs; 
SELECT title FROM songs WHERE mood = "epic" OR released >1990;

Step 3
People get picky at the end of the night. 
Add another SELECT that uses AND to show the titles of songs that are 'epic', and released after 1990, and less than 4 minutes long.
Note that the duration column is measured in seconds.

SELECT title FROM songs; 
SELECT title FROM songs WHERE mood = "epic" OR released >1990;
SELECT title FROM songs WHERE mood = "epic" AND released >1990 AND duration < 240;

Querying IN subqueries
CREATE TABLE exercise_logs
    (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    type TEXT,
    minutes INTEGER, 
    calories INTEGER,
    heart_rate INTEGER);

INSERT INTO exercise_logs(type, minutes, calories, heart_rate) VALUES ("biking", 30, 100, 110);
INSERT INTO exercise_logs(type, minutes, calories, heart_rate) VALUES ("biking", 10, 30, 105);
INSERT INTO exercise_logs(type, minutes, calories, heart_rate) VALUES ("dancing", 15, 200, 120);
INSERT INTO exercise_logs(type, minutes, calories, heart_rate) VALUES ("tree climbing", 30, 70, 90);
INSERT INTO exercise_logs(type, minutes, calories, heart_rate) VALUES ("tree climbing", 25, 72, 80);
INSERT INTO exercise_logs(type, minutes, calories, heart_rate) VALUES ("rowing", 30, 70, 90);
INSERT INTO exercise_logs(type, minutes, calories, heart_rate) VALUES ("hiking", 60, 80, 85);

SELECT * FROM exercise_logs WHERE type = "biking" OR type = "hiking" OR type = "tree climbing" OR type = "rowing";

/* IN */
SELECT * FROM exercise_logs WHERE type IN ("biking", "hiking", "tree climbing", "rowing");

CREATE TABLE drs_favorites
    (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    type TEXT,
    reason TEXT);
  
INSERT INTO drs_favorites(type, reason) VALUES ("biking", "Improves endurance and flexibility.");
INSERT INTO drs_favorites(type, reason) VALUES ("hiking", "Increases cardiovascular health.");

SELECT type FROM drs_favorites;

SELECT * FROM exercise_logs WHERE type IN (
    SELECT type FROM drs_favorites);
    
SELECT * FROM exercise_logs WHERE type IN (
    SELECT type FROM drs_favorites WHERE reason = "Increases cardiovascular health");
    
/* LIKE */

SELECT * FROM exercise_logs WHERE type IN (
    SELECT type FROM drs_favorites WHERE reason LIKE "%cardiovascular%");

Challenge: Playlist maker
Step 1
We've created a database of songs and artists, and you'll make playlists from them in this challenge. 
In this first step, select the title of all the songs by the artist named 'Queen'.

CREATE TABLE artists (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT,
    country TEXT,
    genre TEXT);

INSERT INTO artists (name, country, genre)
    VALUES ("Taylor Swift", "US", "Pop");
INSERT INTO artists (name, country, genre)
    VALUES ("Led Zeppelin", "US", "Hard rock");
INSERT INTO artists (name, country, genre)
    VALUES ("ABBA", "Sweden", "Disco");
INSERT INTO artists (name, country, genre)
    VALUES ("Queen", "UK", "Rock");
INSERT INTO artists (name, country, genre)
    VALUES ("Celine Dion", "Canada", "Pop");
INSERT INTO artists (name, country, genre)
    VALUES ("Meatloaf", "US", "Hard rock");
INSERT INTO artists (name, country, genre)
    VALUES ("Garth Brooks", "US", "Country");
INSERT INTO artists (name, country, genre)
    VALUES ("Shania Twain", "Canada", "Country");
INSERT INTO artists (name, country, genre)
    VALUES ("Rihanna", "US", "Pop");
INSERT INTO artists (name, country, genre)
    VALUES ("Guns N' Roses", "US", "Hard rock");
INSERT INTO artists (name, country, genre)
    VALUES ("Gloria Estefan", "US", "Pop");
INSERT INTO artists (name, country, genre)
    VALUES ("Bob Marley", "Jamaica", "Reggae");

CREATE TABLE songs (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    artist TEXT,
    title TEXT);

INSERT INTO songs (artist, title)
    VALUES ("Taylor Swift", "Shake it off");
INSERT INTO songs (artist, title)
    VALUES ("Rihanna", "Stay");
INSERT INTO songs (artist, title)
    VALUES ("Celine Dion", "My heart will go on");
INSERT INTO songs (artist, title)
    VALUES ("Celine Dion", "A new day has come");
INSERT INTO songs (artist, title)
    VALUES ("Shania Twain", "Party for two");
INSERT INTO songs (artist, title)
    VALUES ("Gloria Estefan", "Conga");
INSERT INTO songs (artist, title)
    VALUES ("Led Zeppelin", "Stairway to heaven");
INSERT INTO songs (artist, title)
    VALUES ("ABBA", "Mamma mia");
INSERT INTO songs (artist, title)
    VALUES ("Queen", "Bicycle Race");
INSERT INTO songs (artist, title)
    VALUES ("Queen", "Bohemian Rhapsody");
INSERT INTO songs (artist, title)
    VALUES ("Guns N' Roses", "Don't cry");
    
SELECT title FROM songs WHERE artist = "Queen";

Step 2
Now you'll make a 'Pop' playlist. In preparation, select the name of all of the artists from the 'Pop' genre.
(Tip: Make sure you type it 'Pop', SQL considers that different from 'pop'.)

SELECT title FROM songs WHERE artist = "Queen";
SELECT name FROM artists WHERE genre = "Pop";

Step 3
To finish creating the 'Pop' playlist, add another query that will select the title of all the songs from the 'Pop' artists. 
It should use IN on a nested subquery that's based on your previous query.

SELECT title FROM songs WHERE artist = "Queen";

SELECT name FROM artists WHERE genre = "Pop";

SELECT title FROM songs 
WHERE artist IN (
SELECT name FROM artists
WHERE genre = "Pop"
);
