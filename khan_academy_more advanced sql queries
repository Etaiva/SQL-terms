Challenge: Karaoke song selector
Step 1
Ever sung karaoke? It's a place where you sing songs with your friends, and it's a lot of fun. 
We've created a table with songs, and in this challenge, you'll use queries to decide what songs to sing. 
For the first step, select all the song titles.

CREATE TABLE songs (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT,
    artist TEXT,
    mood TEXT,
    duration INTEGER,
    released INTEGER);
    
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released)
    VALUES ("Bohemian Rhapsody", "Queen", "epic", 60, 1975);
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released)
    VALUES ("Let it go", "Idina Menzel", "epic", 227, 2013);
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released)
    VALUES ("I will survive", "Gloria Gaynor", "epic", 198, 1978);
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released)
    VALUES ("Twist and Shout", "The Beatles", "happy", 152, 1963);
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released)
    VALUES ("La Bamba", "Ritchie Valens", "happy", 166, 1958);
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released)
    VALUES ("I will always love you", "Whitney Houston", "epic", 273, 1992);
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released)
    VALUES ("Sweet Caroline", "Neil Diamond", "happy", 201, 1969);
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released)
    VALUES ("Call me maybe", "Carly Rae Jepsen", "happy", 193, 2011);
    
SELECT title FROM songs;
    
Step 2
Maybe your friends only like singing either recent songs or truly epic songs. 
Add another SELECT that uses OR to show the titles of the songs that have an 'epic' mood or a release date after 1990.

(Tip: If you're not sure how to select rows where a column equals a value, remember that you can check the documentation below.)

SELECT title FROM songs; 
SELECT title FROM songs WHERE mood = "epic" OR released >1990;

Step 3
People get picky at the end of the night. 
Add another SELECT that uses AND to show the titles of songs that are 'epic', and released after 1990, and less than 4 minutes long.
Note that the duration column is measured in seconds.

SELECT title FROM songs; 
SELECT title FROM songs WHERE mood = "epic" OR released >1990;
SELECT title FROM songs WHERE mood = "epic" AND released >1990 AND duration < 240;
