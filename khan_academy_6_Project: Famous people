Project: Famous people
In this project, you’re going to make your own table with some small set of “famous people”, 
then make more tables about things they do and join those to create nice human readable lists.

For example, here are types of famous people and the questions your data could answer:

Movie stars: What movies are they in? Are they married to each other?
Singers: What songs did they write? Where are they from?
Authors: What books did they write?
Fictional characters: How are they related to other characters? What books do they show up in?

/* Create table about the people and what they do here */
CREATE TABLE author (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    fullname TEXT,
    age INTEGER,
    nationality TEXT);
    
INSERT INTO author (fullname, age, nationality) VALUES ("Jim Collins", 64, "USA");
INSERT INTO author (fullname, age, nationality) VALUES ("Tom Peters", 79, "USA");
INSERT INTO author (fullname, age, nationality) VALUES ("Peter Senge", 75, "USA");
INSERT INTO author (fullname, age, nationality) VALUES ("Lynda Gratton", 67, "UK");
INSERT INTO author (fullname, age, nationality) VALUES ("J. K. Rowling", 56, "UK");

CREATE table wealth (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    author_id INTEGER,
    net_worth TEXT,
    source_wealth TEXT);
    
INSERT INTO wealth (author_id, net_worth, source_wealth) VALUES (1, "$30 million", "business research");
INSERT INTO wealth (author_id, net_worth, source_wealth) VALUES (2, "$17 million", "business management practices");
INSERT INTO wealth (author_id, net_worth, source_wealth) VALUES (3, "$5 million", "systmes scientist");
INSERT INTO wealth (author_id, net_worth, source_wealth) VALUES (4, "$950,000", "business theorist");
INSERT INTO wealth (author_id, net_worth, source_wealth) VALUES (5, "$1 billion", "fiction");


/*Return total net worth for each billionare*/
SELECT author.fullname, wealth.net_worth
FROM author
JOIN wealth
ON author.id = wealth.author_id;
