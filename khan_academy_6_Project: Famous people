Project: Famous people
In this project, you’re going to make your own table with some small set of “famous people”, 
then make more tables about things they do and join those to create nice human readable lists.

For example, here are types of famous people and the questions your data could answer:

Movie stars: What movies are they in? Are they married to each other?
Singers: What songs did they write? Where are they from?
Authors: What books did they write?
Fictional characters: How are they related to other characters? What books do they show up in?

/* Create table about the people and what they do here */
CREATE TABLE famous_people (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, 
    name TEXT,
    category TEXT);
    
INSERT INTO famous_people (name, category)
    VALUES ("Will Smith", "actor");
INSERT INTO famous_people (name, category)
    VALUES ("Will Smith", "author");
INSERT INTO famous_people (name, category)
    VALUES ("Tom Cruise", "actor");
INSERT INTO famous_people (name, category)
    VALUES ("Will Smith", "singer");
INSERT INTO famous_people (name, category)
    VALUES ("Nicole Kidman", "actor");

CREATE TABLE content (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    content_name TEXT,
    category TEXT,
    artist TEXT);
    
INSERT INTO content (content_name, category, artist)
    VALUES ("Just the Two of Us", "singer", "Will Smith");
INSERT INTO content (content_name, category, artist)

INSERT INTO content (content_name, category, artist)
    VALUES ("Mission Impossible", "actor", "Tom Cruise");
INSERT INTO content (content_name, category, artist)
    VALUES ("The Northman", "actor", "Nicole Kidman");
    
CREATE TABLE characters (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    character_name TEXT,
    famous_person TEXT,
    publication_name TEXT,
    publication_year INTEGER);
    
INSERT INTO characters (character_name, famous_person, publication_name, publication_year)
